Welcome to the <strong>Data Cleaning for Machine Learning</strong> repository!  
Created by <strong>Yusuf Abdurrahman</strong> as part of a learning journey in data preprocessing for machine learning.  
This repository contains documentation, code, and practical examples of data cleaning before moving into ML modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository aims to:

- Understand key concepts in data cleaning
- Apply data cleaning techniques directly on real datasets
- Build a strong foundation before moving on to machine learning modeling

## 📔 Main Notebook

👉 **[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your_notebook_link_here)**

> 📁 File: `data-cleaning-practice-2.ipynb`  
> All data cleaning steps are organized in a step-by-step manner within a single notebook. 

## 📚 Topics Covered

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Handling Missing Values** (`NaN`, null)
2. **Removing Duplicate Records**
3. **Renaming Columns**
4. **Changing Data Types**
5. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**
6. **Detecting and Handling Outliers**
7. **Text Case Normalization**
8. imbalance data

## 📦 Tools & Libraries

- Google Colab (Python 3)
- `pandas`, `numpy`

## ✅ Learning Checklist

- [x] Handling missing data (`dropna()`, `fillna()`)
- [x] Removing duplicate entries
- [x] Renaming columns (`rename()`)
- [x] Changing column data types (`astype()`, `pd.to_datetime()`, etc.)
- [x] Dropping irrelevant columns (`drop()`)
- [x] Detecting and handling outliers (`IQR`, `Z-score`)
- [x] Text Case Normalization
